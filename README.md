Flight Ticket Price Prediction Project
The objective of this project is to predict the prices of airline tickets based on various features.

The pricing of airline tickets is influenced by a range of factors, each contributing to the final fare. Key among these factors is the airline itself, with different carriers offering varied pricing structures. The departure and arrival locations, including the specific airports, play a pivotal role, and flights between certain desirable destinations may command higher prices.

-Flight details, such as the number of stops or layovers and the duration of the journey, are critical determinants of ticket prices. The type of aircraft used for the flight, along with the seating class (economy, business, first class), contributes significantly to the overall fare.

-Temporal factors, including the departure date and time, can influence ticket prices, with peak travel times often associated with higher fares. Special events, holidays, and seasonal fluctuations may also impact pricing.

-External features, like weather conditions at the departure and arrival locations, can influence travel demand and subsequently affect ticket prices. The day and time of booking, along with any recent changes or updates to the flight schedule, may play a role in determining fares.

-In essence, the interplay of these diverse elements shapes the perceived value of an airline ticket in the market
